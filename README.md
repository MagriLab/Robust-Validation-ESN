In this repository we show the code for the validation strategies for Echo State Networks by A.Racca and L.Magri published in Neural Networks (2021), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2021.05.004. A preprint can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03174.

An updated version of the Echo State Network implementation can be found at https://github.com/alberacca/Echo-State-Networks.

For more details on how the code works, there is an additional README file inside the source folder.
